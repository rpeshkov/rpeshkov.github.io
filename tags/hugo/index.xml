      <description>This site is built entirely with Hugo. Hugo itself has a lot of useful commands bundled, but there&amp;rsquo;s one case which is missing for me: update timestamp of some particular post without editing it manually.
My usecase for this is that when I generate new post, I might be writing in more than 1 day because of different reasons. But when I finish the post and want to publish it, I want post to have the date when it was finished.</description>
